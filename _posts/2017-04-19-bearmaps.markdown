![BearMaps](../assets/images/bearmaps.png)

This was a project for my Data Structures course: CS61B. The project specification can be found [here](http://datastructur.es/sp17/materials/proj/proj3/proj3.html). The project was deployed using <i>Quilt</i>.

- Developed a GoogleMaps-esque web application on IntelliJ that allows users to interact with a map of Berkeley.
- The application supported features such as route searching, zooming, scrolling, location searching, autocomplete, and map rastering.
- Implemented search algorithms such as <i>A\*</i> and <i>Dijkstra's</i> algorithm to find shortest route between two given locations and utilized data structures such as quadtrees, hashtables, and tries.

<p><i>Note: </i>Code for this project cannot be shared due to course policy.</p>
