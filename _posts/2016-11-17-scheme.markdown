![Scheme](../assets/images/scheme.png)

This was a project for my Computer Science course: CS61A. The project specification can be found [here](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa16/proj/scheme/).

- Used Python to create an interpreter for programming language Scheme, a dialect of the functional language Lisp.
- Applied principles of tree recursion, lexical and syntactic analysis, and functional programming.

<p><i>Note: </i>Code for this project cannot be shared due to course policy.</p>
