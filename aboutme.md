Hey! I'm Rishab. Here are some random facts about me:

- I'm a student at UC Berkeley
- I like watching TV shows (talk to me about GoT, Sherlock, Narcos, House of Cards, Silicon Valley)
- My taste in music has changed in recent times (Two Door Cinema CLub, alt-J, Arctic Monkeys, Halsey)
- I like adding song lyrics in the middle of my conversations
- *Triangles are my favorite shape*

What else do you need?

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
