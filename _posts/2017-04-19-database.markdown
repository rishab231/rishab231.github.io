This was a project for my Data Structures course: CS61B. The project specification can be found [here](http://datastructur.es/sp17/materials/proj/proj2/proj2.html).

- Designed and developed the API for a relational database management system (RDBMS) as well as Domain Specific Language (DSL) similar to SQL.
- The system supported user queries such as create/load/store/print table, joins, filtering and arithmetic/NaN/NoValue operations
- Used IntelliJ, git version control, and JUnit testing

<p><i>Note: </i>Code for this project cannot be shared due to course policy.</p>
