This was a project for my Computer Science course: CS61A. The project specification can be found [here](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa16/proj/maps/).

- Created a Voronoi visualisation of restaurant ratings using machine learning and the Yelp academic dataset.
- Implemented the k-means unsupervised learning algorithm to group restaurants into clusters based on their location.
- Used a least-squares regression to recommend restaurants to users based on certain inputs such as ratings, location, cuisine, and price.
