Intractable Problems:<i>The Modified Traveling Salesman Project</i>
</strong>
<img src="assets/images/map.png" alt="The Modified Traveling Salesman Problem">
</p>
This was a project for my Algorithms course: CS170. The project specification can be found <a href="cs170-spec.pdf">here</a>.
<br>
<strong>Brief:</strong>
<br>
The project was a modified version of the famous intractable problem: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Given an input graph where each vertex represents a kingdom, and there exixt edge weights as well as conquering costs for each kingdom; our task was to design and develop an algorithm that <b>conquers all kingdoms (vertices)</b> while minimizing the <i>Total Cost</i> = ∑ Conquering costs + ∑ Traveling costs.

<br>
<ul>The project was trickier than the TSP because of certain special rules that the project allowed:
	<li>Once you conquer a kingdom, all its neighbours are automatically conquered.</li>
	<li>Kingdoms can be visited without conquering them.</li>
	<li>One must begin and end the tour at the starting kingdom given to us.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<strong>The algorithm:</strong>
<ul>We utilized a two-part approach to derive a solution given an input instance:
	<li><b>Finding the set of <i>special</i> nodes to conquer</b></li>
	We used a greedy strategy to find a set of special vertices.
	<li><b>Generating a cheap tour through these special nodes</b></li>
