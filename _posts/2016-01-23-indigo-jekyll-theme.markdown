![The Modified Traveling Salesman Problem](../assets/images/map.png)

The project was a modified version of the famous intractable problem: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Given an input graph where each vertex represents a kingdom, and there exist edge weights as well as vertex costs for each kingdom; our task was to design and develop an algorithm that <b>conquers all kingdoms (vertices)</b> while minimizing the <i>Total Cost</i> = ∑ Conquering costs + ∑ Traveling costs.
