An application designed and developed during my internship at Helios Capital Management to supplement my research into equities in the Indian stock market.

- Developed a data-driven pair-trading algorithm using graph theory to find statistical arbitrage opportunities.
- On a simplified level, constructed a *NetworkX* graph where each node represents a company's stock and an edge represents a historical correlation between two companies' stock price (using complements and substitute technique).
- Developed multiple pair trading investment strategies based on price movements in the macro-stock market graph.
